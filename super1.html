      <h3>Powers</h3>
      <p>As a Kryptonian, Kal-El possesses the ability to absorb the solar energy
        from yellow stars. His Kryptonian body is constantly absorbing and storing
        energy from Earth's yellow sun (allowing him to retain energy under roofed
        structures and even at night) which in turn grants him incredible powers,
        including superhuman strength, enhanced senses, impenetrable skin, and
        the ability to defy gravity. His body is also able to absorb the energy
        of a blue sun, which also grants him increased strength and various other
        powers (although not to the same degree as under a yellow sun). Superman
        has also demonstrated the ability to absorb certain other forms of energy,
        such as the anti-sunlight of Mageddon.</p>
