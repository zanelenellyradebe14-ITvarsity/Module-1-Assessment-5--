    <h3>Powers</h3>
    <p>Though he does not possess any innate superhuman abilities, Batman is considered
      by many (evenÂ Superman) to be among the most dangerous men in the world.
      Throughout the many years that he has been around, Batman has become one
      of the most powerful human beings in the DC Universe, despite having no superhuman
      powers at any time in his life. Starting at the age of 14, Bruce began to
      train with brilliant minds on the planet to learn about biology, criminology,
      anatomy and other areas that would help him become the World's Greatest Detective.</p>
