    <h3>Powers</h3>
    <p>Wonder Womanâ€™s powers are a result of the blessings she received from the gods
      (or presumably in the modern version by her divine ancestry), but originally
      came from her "brain energy" training. Her abilities in large part come from
      her upbringing in the martial society of the Amazons. She is one of the most
      powerful superheroes in the DC universe.</p>
